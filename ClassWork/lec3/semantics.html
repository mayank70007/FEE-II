                <mark>Dennis Ritchie “Father of the C programming language” </mark> also created UNIX operating system
                along with
                his long-time colleague Ken Thompson. He was an American Computer Scientist. In 1983 he received the
                Turing Award from the ACM, the Hamming Medal in 1990 from the IEEE and in 1999 the National Medal of
                Technology from President Clinton. Ritchie was the head of the Lucent Technologies System Software
                Research Department when he retired in 2007.
                Modern computing would not have existed without Dennis Ritchie, Without C there is no UNIX, Windows,
                Linux, C++, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, MacOSX, Playstation, Xbox and a lot of software and devices.
                90% of applications in the world are written in C and that’s the reason Dennis Ritchie deserves a lot of
                respect.<br><br><br>

        <article>In 1967, Ritchie began working at the Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center. In 1968, he defended
            his PhD thesis on "Computational Complexity and Program Structure" at Harvard under the supervision of
            Patrick C. Fischer. However, Ritchie never officially received his PhD degree as he did not submit a bound
            copy of his dissertation to the Harvard library, a requirement for the degree.[7][8] In 2020, the Computer
            History Museum worked with Ritchie's family and Fischer's family and found a copy of the lost
            dissertation.[8][9]

            During the 1960s, Ritchie and Ken Thompson worked on the Multics operating system at Bell Labs. Thompson
            then found an old PDP-7 machine and developed his own application programs and operating system from
            scratch, aided by Ritchie and others. In 1970, Brian Kernighan suggested the name "Unix", a pun on the name
            "Multics".[10] To supplement assembly language with a system-level programming language, Thompson created B.
            Later, B was replaced by C, created by Ritchie, who continued to contribute to the development of Unix and C
            for many years.[11]</article><br><br><br>
        <article>During the 1970s, Ritchie collaborated with James Reeds and Robert Morris on a ciphertext-only attack
            on the M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.[12] Ritchie relates
            that, after discussions with the National Security Agency, the authors decided not to publish it, as they
            were told that the principle applied to machines still in use by foreign governments.[12]

            Ritchie was also involved with the development of the Plan 9 and Inferno operating systems, and the
            programming language Limbo.


            As part of an AT&T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he

            Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 – c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist.[3]
            He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system
            and B programming language.[3] Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the
            Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in
            1999.

            Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.

            Early life and education
            Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York. His father was Alistair E. Ritchie, a longtime Bell Labs
            scientist and co-author of The Design of Switching Circuits[4] on switching circuit theory.[5] As a child,
            Dennis moved with his family to Summit, New Jersey, where he graduated from Summit High School.[6] He
            graduated from Harvard University with degrees in physics and applied mathematics in 1963.[5]

            PhD thesis on "Computational Complexity and Program Structure" at Harvard under the supervision of Patrick

            M-209 US cipher machine that could solve messages of at least 2000–2500 letters.[12] Ritchie relates that,

            programming language Limbo.

            As part of an AT&T restructuring in the mid-1990s, Ritchie was transferred to Lucent Technologies, where he
            retired in 2007 as head of System Software Research Department.[13]

            C and Unix
            Ritchie created the C programming language and was one of the developers of the Unix operating system. With
            Brian Kernighan, he co-wrote the book The C Programming Language, which is often referred to as K&R after
            their initials. Ritchie worked together with Ken Thompson, who is credited with writing the original version
            of Unix; one of Ritchie's contributions to Unix was its porting to different machines and platforms.[14]
            They were so influential on Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, "The names of Ritchie and Thompson
            may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed."[15]

            Nowadays, the C language is widely used in application, operating system, and embedded system development,
            and its influence is seen in most modern programming languages. C is a low-level language with constructs
            closely translating to the hardware's instruction set. However, it is not tied to any particular
            hardware—making it easy to write programs on any machine that supports C.[16] Moreover, C is a high-level
            language with constructs mapping to the application's data structures.
